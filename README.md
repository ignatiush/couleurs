Work I did for an iOS app created during Budweiser's Smart Bar Hackathon
The app was conceptualized on having bartenders analyze sales based on flowmeter data.
Based on their analysis, they could determine which beers/drinks were not selling well and have ad-hoc hourly discounts.
They could input the discount details on parse.com and have a push notification sent to users when new discounts were added.

My work was to setup the backend on parse.com as well as create an API in Swift to pull data off parse.com when users launched the app.
